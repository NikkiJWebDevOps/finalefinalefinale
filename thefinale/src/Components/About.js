      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Hello my name is Johnathan! Ive loved and cherished dogs more than people most of my life,however I did not choose this career path until I was 18. Starting from the bottom, Ive built a 14yr+ career in the pet grooming industry and have no current plans on stopping. 
      
      Working in various salons across the city as well as several mentorships and continuous educational classes, Ive become one of the few NDGAA certified groomers in this city. I am also in the process of becoming master certified. The Zen Pup is my very first salon, and is my pride and joy. I keep the mindset of being a forever student so The Zen Pup will always be evolving and working its way to being an eco friendly salon while providing the healthiest most informed care for your pets within my capabilities.</p>
